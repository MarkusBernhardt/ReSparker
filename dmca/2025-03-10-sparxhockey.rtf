\cf3 GitHub user providing unauthorized access tools and instructions to access DMCA covered software code that authenticates products. These tools enable users to unlock and provide unauthorized access which compromises safety and security of users.\cf0 \
\
\cf2 Dear GitHub Support Team,\
\
We are writing to report copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and to formally request the immediate removal of content hosted on GitHub\cf0 . This content not only violates our intellectual property rights but also breaches GitHub\'92s Acceptable Use Policies. Specifically, a user on your platform has posted unauthorized instructions and tools that enable others to unlock our secure products, Sparx Hockey Skate Sharpeners and related accessories.\
\
Sparx Hockey Skate Sharpeners are tools used by consumers and professionals to sharpen the blades of ice skates. These tools have high-speed moving parts. These tools are tested and covered by international product safety standards.\
\
\cf3 The GitHub user MarkusBernhardt is explaining on your website how to sniff encrypted security passwords and alter them to access and operate our products in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Service.\cf0  This includes providing tools and detailed instructions for rewriting and bypassing our security measures. T\cf3 his user also supplies layouts of encrypted data stored on our product. \cf0 The above information can be used by others to enable unsafe operation of our products.\
\
Such activity compromises not only our intellectual property but also poses significant safety risks to users operating the system after those security measures have been circumvented.\
\
\cf3 Under the Sparx Hockey Terms of Service, users expressly agree not to:  \
\'93disable, circumvent, or otherwise avoid or undermine any security device, mechanism, protocol, or procedure implemented in the Service.\'94\cf0 \
\
Additionally, this activity violates GitHub\'92s policy, which prohibits:  \
\'95 \'93You may not use GitHub to violate the law, including by distributing malicious software or unauthorized access tools.\'941  \
\'95 \'93You may not post any content that infringes any third-party\'92s intellectual property or privacy rights.\'941\
\
We respectfully request that GitHub:  \
\'95 Immediately remove the infringing content from your platform as part of this DMCA takedown notice.  \
\'95 Investigate the user\'92s activity and take appropriate measures, including banning the user, to prevent further violations.\
\
For your reference, the infringing content can be found at the following URL:  \

\
I hope this email helps you understand the seriousness of the actions that GitHub has already taken by permitting this user\'92s content, which is in violation of GitHub\'92s Acceptable Use Policy, to be published on your site.\
\
This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\'94DMCA\'94), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.\

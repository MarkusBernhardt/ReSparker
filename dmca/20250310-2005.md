Hi Markus Bernhardt,

I'm contacting you on behalf of GitHub because we've received a DMCA takedown notice regarding the following content:

https://github.com/MarkusBernhardt/ReSparker

We're giving you 1 business day to make the changes identified in the following notice:

https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/attachments/token/iN6YYdnJFHY9raQ0vq6dh2E9h/?name=2025-03-10-sparxhockey.rtf

If you need to remove specific content from your repository, simply making the repository private or deleting it via a commit won't resolve the alleged infringement. Instead, you must follow these instructions to remove the content from your repository's history, even if you don't think it's sensitive:

https://docs.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data

Once you've made changes, please reply to this message and let us know. If you don't tell us that you've made changes within the next 1 business day, we'll need to disable the entire repository according to our GitHub DMCA Takedown Policy:

https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/

If you believe your content on GitHub was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by submitting a counter notice, as described in our DMCA Takedown Policy.

PLEASE NOTE: It is important that you reply to this message within 1 business day to tell us whether you've made changes. If you do not, the repository will be disabled.
